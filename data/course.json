It\u2019s up to us.\n\nIn the 21st century, powerful technologies have been appearing at a breathtaking pace\u2014related to the internet, artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and more. They have amazing potential upsides, but we can\u2019t ignore the serious risks that come with them.\n\n_Brave New Planet_ is a podcast that delves deep into the most exciting and challenging scientific frontiers, helping us understand them and grapple with their implications. Dr. Eric Lander, president and founding director of the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) of MIT and Harvard, is a geneticist, molecular biologist, and mathematician who was a leader of the Human Genome Project and for eight years served as a science advisor to the White House for President Obama. He\u2019s also the host of _Brave New Planet_, and he\u2019s talked to leading researchers, journalists, doctors, policy makers, activists, and legal experts to illuminate how this generation\u2019s choices will shape the future as never before.\n\n_Brave New Planet_ is a partnership between the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), [Pushkin Industries](https://www.pushkin.fm/), and the [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/).",
